# **Project Description: TrabajoFinalPDL**

## **Title**: Trabajo Final - Procesadores del Lenguaje  
**Objective**: Design and develop a compiler for a reduced grammar subset of the C programming language, using **Java** and the **IntelliJ IDEA** IDE.

## **Extended Description**

The **TrabajoFinalPDL** project aims to provide a hands-on implementation of the key principles behind language processors. By focusing on a reduced grammar subset of the C programming language, the project encompasses the full pipeline of a compiler's operation, from lexical analysis to syntactic and semantic processing. This compiler will validate, parse, and translate input code into an appropriate intermediate representation while maintaining compliance with basic C-like programming constructs.

The project includes three major **phases of analysis**: Lexical, Sintactic and Semantic.
